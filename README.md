Introduction :
         The CUCU Compiler project aims to develop a compiler for a simple toy programming language called CUCU (A Compiler U Can Understand). This project focuses on learning compiler design principles and implementation.

Project Components
The project includes the following files and components:

      cucu.l: Lexer file that tokenizes variable names, keywords, special characters, and numbers.
      cucu.y: Parser file containing BNF grammar rules for the compiler.
      Lexer.txt: Output file for tokens generated by cucu.l.
      Parser.txt: Output file for parsing steps generated by cucu.y.
      cucu.tab.c, cucu.tab.h: Files generated by Bison containing parser implementation.
      lex.yy.c: File generated by Flex containing lexer implementation.
      cucu: Executable file generated after compiling lexer and parser.
      Sample1.cu: Sample code file with correct syntax.
      Sample2.cu: Sample code file with incorrect syntax.
