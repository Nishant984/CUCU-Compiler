### README for CUCU Compiler Project

#### Introduction
The CUCU Compiler project aims to develop a compiler for a simple toy programming language called CUCU (A Compiler U Can Understand). This project focuses on learning compiler design principles and implementation.

#### Project Components
- **cucu.l**: Lexer file that tokenizes variable names, keywords, special characters, and numbers.
- **cucu.y**: Parser file containing BNF grammar rules for the compiler.
- **Lexer.txt**: Output file for tokens generated by `cucu.l`.
- **Parser.txt**: Output file for parsing steps generated by `cucu.y`.
- **cucu.tab.c, cucu.tab.h**: Files generated by Bison containing parser implementation.
- **lex.yy.c**: File generated by Flex containing lexer implementation.
- **cucu**: Executable file generated after compiling lexer and parser.
- **Sample1.cu**: Sample code file with correct syntax.
- **Sample2.cu**: Sample code file with incorrect syntax.

#### Instructions to Run
To compile and execute the CUCU compiler:
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   flex cucu.l
   bison -d cucu.y
   gcc cucu.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl -o cucu
3.Execute the compiler with correct syntax:
     ```bash
         
         Copy code
        ./cucu Sample1.cu
4.Execute the compiler with incorrect syntax:
   ```bash
     Copy code
    ./cucu Sample2.cu
